- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
mounting phase- building the component setup inital data which gets rendered and componentDidMount- setup and saves state in component
updating phase- at this point setState is used to change the state
unmounting phase- component is removed from screen...state removed
- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
custom hooks allow you to make up what you need to fit you best in whatever situation you have. 
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
in bigger apps, this saves time in the long run to find bugs and allows us to write cleaner code in the process. in smaller components it allows to find issues in the little things like logic that may have a loophole.
